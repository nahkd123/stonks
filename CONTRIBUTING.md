# Ways to contribute
## Get people to try Stonks
The simplest way to help this project accelerate is by getting someone to try Stonks. Of course, being Fabric-only mod in this early stage of development means that Stonks can't reach to most server owners, but if you know a server owner that's using Fabric, you can tell them to try Stonks.

More people using this mods means more bug will be discovered, ensuring the quality of this project.

## Report bugs
Did your server crashed? Is it because of Stonks? Did you found a duplication glitch? Then don't forget to report it in [project issues tracker](https://github.com/nahkd123/stonks/issues).

## Contribute to documentations
Some people are not insanely smart to figure out how to use Stonks. That's why I want some poeple to help with documentations.

All documentations are maintained in `docs/<version>` branches. For example, documentations for Stonks for Minecraft 1.21 are stored in `docs/1.21.x`. Please note that only the branch whose version is equals to main branch's version (eg: main branch is `main/1.21.x` then the docs branch must be `docs/1.21.x`) is used for https://nahkd123.github.io/stonks/ page. Other branches are meant for historical/archival purpose (so if you are still using Stonks for MC 1.20.6, you can checkout `docs/1.20.x`).
