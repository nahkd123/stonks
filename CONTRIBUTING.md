# Ways to contribute
## Get people to try Stonks
The simplest way to help this project accelerate is by getting someone to try Stonks. Of course, being Fabric-only mod in this early stage of development means that Stonks can't reach to most server owners, but if you know a server owner that's using Fabric, you can tell them to try Stonks.

More people using this mods means more bug will be discovered, ensuring the quality of this project.

## Report bugs
Did your server crashed? Is it because of Stonks? Did you found a duplication glitch? Then don't forget to report it in [project issues tracker](https://github.com/nahkd123/stonks/issues).

## Contribute to documentations
Some people are not insanely smart to figure out how to use Stonks. That's why I want some poeple to help with documentations.

### User's documentations (a.k.a Wiki)
Currently, [Wiki](https://github.com/nahkd123/stonks/wiki) can only edited by collaborators. I'm planning to use GitHub Pages for all kind of documentations.
